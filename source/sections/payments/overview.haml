    %p Sign2pay offers a few different approaches to processing payments. While there are many ways to implement, these approaches can be divided into two main categories: <a href="/sections/payments/on-demand/overview.html">On-Demand</a> and <a href="/sections/payments/preapproval/overview.html">Pre-Approved</a>.

    %p We're also pretty excited about our new <a href="/sections/payments/sms/overview.html">SMS Payments</a>, but more about that later ;)
